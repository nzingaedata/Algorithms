        "One of the most significant impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic may be a shift in how the workplace and workforce operate in the future. According to Forbes, approximately 5% of white-collar employees in the U.S. worked primarily from home before the outbreak. This figure skyrocketed to 71% during the pandemic. If given a choice to continue working from home post-pandemic, 54% of these workers indicated they would continue to do so, according to Pew Research Center. These figures will likely vary across occupations, industries, income, and education levels. As remote work becomes more popular, white-collar workers are likely to relocate from city centers to suburban areas, accelerating and changing geographic trends.\n",

        "A report by the Economic Innovation Group (EIG) indicated that more than two-thirds of large urban counties saw their populations decline. Marking the first time in 50 years, counties with a population over 250,000  experienced negative growth. Although migration patterns had been in effect before Covid-19, the explosion of remote work during the pandemic, reductions in births, rising deaths, and delayed immigration accelerated the shift. EIG indicated other contributing factors, including high median home and apartment rental prices, low housing inventory, and increasing costs of consumer goods such as gas. \n",
